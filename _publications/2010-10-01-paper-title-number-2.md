excerpt: 'This paper investigates the relationship between the use of student support services and academic performance in a research methodology module during the COVID-19 pandemic. It focuses on whether students who frequently accessed services such as tutoring, consultations, and online resources performed significantly better than those who made limited use of them. The study highlights how structured academic support played a critical role in helping students adapt to remote learning challenges. Findings emphasize the importance of institutional support systems in improving student outcomes, particularly during periods of disruption and uncertainty.'

Hello, I’m Tawanda Maziriri — welcome to my digital home! My journey has taken me through business and law, and now into the exciting world of technology. Over time, I’ve come to see how these fields connect, and I’m passionate about exploring the ways they shape our lives, societies, and futures.

This site is where I bring those interests together. You’ll find reflections on my personal journey, notes from my learning in software development, and articles that dive into topics in business and law. I’m also building this space as a foundation for my future academic research, so some of the content leans toward critical thinking and exploration.

At the same time, I want this to feel like a conversation. It’s not just a portfolio or blog, but a growing record of ideas, challenges, and lessons I’ve picked up along the way. So please, feel free to browse around, read, and even reach out if something sparks your curiosity. This is more than just a website — it’s my evolving notebook of growth, learning, and discovery.

My Journey
======
🎓 Foundations in Law & Business (2016–2020)

My journey began with a strong focus on the world of law and business. In 2020, I graduated with a BCom Law, a qualification that gave me the ability to think critically, analyze systems, and understand how businesses and societies function within legal frameworks. This period was about building the discipline and perspective that continue to guide me today.

📚 Expanding into Business Management (2020–2021)

Eager to build on that foundation, I pursued BCom Honours in Business Management with UNISA. This exposed me to leadership strategies, organizational structures, and the dynamics of business in a rapidly changing world. More importantly, it sparked a question within me: How can I integrate traditional business knowledge with innovation and future-focused industries?

💻 Discovery of Technology (2021–2023)

That question led me to the IT industry, where I discovered a passion for technology and its role in shaping tomorrow’s businesses. From coding experiments to understanding the digital landscape, I began integrating technical curiosity with my background in law and business. This exploration opened my eyes to the power of technology as both a tool and a driver of change.

☁️ The Path Toward Cloud Engineering (2023–Present)

Today, my focus is on Cloud Engineering — particularly on the aspects of compliance, governance, and regulation. This field allows me to combine my legal background, business knowledge, and growing technical expertise in a way that feels both natural and exciting. It is a space where innovation and accountability must work hand in hand, and I want to be part of that intersection.

🔮 Looking Ahead

Where I see myself is at the crossroads of law, business, and technology. My goal is to pursue deeper research and advanced studies that contribute to building compliant, ethical, and innovative solutions in the cloud space. This website is more than a portfolio — it is a reflection of my journey, my growth, and my ongoing commitment to bridging different worlds in meaningful ways.

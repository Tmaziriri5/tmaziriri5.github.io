Hello, and welcome to my corner of the internet. My name is Tawanda, though most people just call me T1/Tawaz. I’m the type of person who lives in between worlds — I like to say I’m an introverted extrovert. On one hand, I enjoy quiet moments, value my personal space, deep thinking, and web-browsing random current affairs related topics. On the other hand, I love adventure, new experiences, and the thrill of pushing myself into the unknown. This website is a reflection of that balance: serious professional work mixed with the lighter, adventurous side of life.

One of my biggest passions is golf. I’m a long hitter, comfortably sending the ball over 300 meters (In winter when its dry of course 😂), and I currently hold a handicap index of 15.5. I'm a decent golfer, I'll show up when least expected and definitely flop dismally when you need me the most in a betterball/matchplay set up 😩.  For me, golf isn’t just about the scorecard — it’s about the discipline, the patience, and the mental toughness that the sport demands. Every round teaches me something new, whether I’m playing a casual 9-hole practice session or grinding through a full round on the weekend. Golf is where I test not just my swing but also my ability to stay calm under pressure, reset after a bad shot, and keep pushing for improvement. 

When I’m not on the golf course, I’m often exploring the world around me. I’ve been fortunate to travel through 9 countries thus far. Each trip has given me a unique story — from the busy cities to the quiet countryside, from border posts to mountain roads. Travel excites me because it’s more than just moving from one place to another; it’s about understanding cultures, meeting new people, and seeing how differently people live, survive, and thrive. It fuels my curiosity and reminds me that life is meant to be lived beyond the familiar.

Career-wise, I’ve built a solid foundation in commercial law. I’ve developed expertise in the field and continue to sharpen it through both practice and academic research. Over time, I’ve developed a strong passion for writing research articles, diving deep into subjects like management, performance, and business sustainability. I enjoy uncovering patterns, asking big questions, and contributing to knowledge in ways that can help businesses and individuals alike. At the same time, I’ve started stepping into the world of technology. Coding, building projects, cloud engineering — it’s all new and exciting. I see tech as more than just a skill; it’s a way of creating solutions and exploring the future.

Beyond law, research, and tech, I’ve got plenty of personal interests that keep life exciting. Cars, for instance, have always fascinated me. Whether it’s experimenting with alternative fuels, thinking about long road trips, or even reviewing high-mileage vehicles for fun, I love the combination of engineering, adventure, and freedom that cars represent. For years now I've been doing my won DIY oil changes every 10-15000km. This gives me a sense of control and ease that my engine is definetly my engine is running on a 5w30 synthetic oil grade. I guess I have trust issues lol.


And of course, life isn’t just about work or discipline. I’m someone who genuinely loves to explore, laugh, and have fun. From competitive road trip challenges to food experiments, from spontaneous adventures to quiet evenings with family and friends, I enjoy living life fully. At the end of the day, it’s these moments — both big and small — that make everything worthwhile.
So this blog is my way of sharing all of that: my professional journey, my growing love for tech, my adventures in golf and travel, and even my personal reflections on life. Some posts will be serious and academic, while others will be fun and lighthearted. But all of it will be authentic.

If you’re reading this, I invite you to join me on this journey. There will be lessons, stories, and maybe even a few laughs along the way. But most of all, there will be a genuine reflection of who I am — someone always exploring, always learning, and always striving to live a life full of meaning and adventure.
